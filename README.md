# Balatro Music Selector
Standalone Cardsauce music selector for Balatro

# DISCLAIMER
I'm NOT a programmer and pretty much the entirety of the code in this mod comes from [Cardsauce](https://github.com/BarrierTrio/Cardsauce/). All I did was change a few things and copypaste some lines. Please, support [the original devs](https://github.com/BarrierTrio).

# Why?
I simply wanted to be able to choose different music, but I didn't want to install Cardsauce in its entirety just for that. So, I identified the chunk of code responsible for that and made it standalone.<br>
This mod was also heavily inspired by [qvattro0](https://github.com/qvattr0)'s [Balatro Music Replacer](https://github.com/qvattr0/balatro-music-replacer) which, however, is not a mod but an external software to literally replace the music files.

# Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è If you have the Cardsauce mod installed, **this mod won't load**. This is by design: since this mod is essentially a piece of the other, I preferred to avoid any issues and conflicts because I currently lack the skills to solve them.<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è If any of the original authors of the soundtracks featured in this mod come forward and ask me to remove their work, **I will comply without question**.<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è For the same reason above, if BarrierTrio asks me to take this mod down, **I will also comply**.<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è The code I came up with is spaghetti. I'm sure there are better ways to do this but, as I said, I currently lack the skills.

# What I hope to do
üîß Make an injector for the Cardsauce mod in order to feature extra tracks even with Cardsauce installed.<br>
<sup>üîß Otherwise, being able to at least override its music selector with this one.</sup><br>
üîß Refactor the code to avoid all those repeated chunks.<br>
<sup>I believe there's a way, but I don't know enough about Lua to do that.</sup><br>
üîß Make this mod modular.<br>
<sup>Would be nice to allow everyone to add their own music by just dropping them inside a specific folder together with a file containing all the info. Sadly, all the music is hardcoded for now.</sup>
